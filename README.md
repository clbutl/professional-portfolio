## Description

This project was a way for me to test my web development skills, while creating a website that will help me in the future. I learned a lot of things from this
challenge. This includes how I need to group my items for my page to be organized well, along with how the order of certain items really does matter.

# Challenges

I had a lot of big obstacles that were in my way while I was creating my website. Each of these took me a while to get through, but I still ended up getting
a finshed product that at least looked professional on the outside. 

## HTML Grouping

A majority of my struggles came from not grouping my HTML Elements together. They all kept getting mixed around, yet at the end of the week I ended up getting
something that I believe to be a somewhat successful website.

## Changing the Structure of my Website When the Page Changes

Another big obstacle was whenever the page changed in size, my elements would go all over the place. I fixed this with using '@media screen' with the changing
size of the screen, and changing the layout of my page accordingly.

## CSS Styling

A big part of my page was CSS Styling, this included the colors, layout, and overall structure of the page. My main issue was getting the elements to stay separate,
yet still come together as an organized group. I solved this by having the HTML structure to my page that I referred to earlier.

##  Conclusion

Overall I think this challenge was very successful, I learned a lot about my abilities and I truly believe that I grew from this. I hope that I met the acceptance
criteria well and I hope my amount of effort is reflected in my work.
